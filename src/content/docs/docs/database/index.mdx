import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


The `OpenDAoC-Core` package comes with a `DummyDB.sql` file that you can use to bootstrap your server.

We also provide the full, open source, database that we used to run our own server and recommend using it as a starting point for your own server as well.

The content of the database is the output of extensive research and testing with the goal of providing the most accurate open source database for the version 1.65 of Dark Age of Camelot.

The database is available in the `OpenDAoC-Database` repository on GitHub and is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 in the hope that it will be useful to the community.

## Usage

To use this databases dump with `OpenDAoC-Core` and `OpenDAoC-PvP`, follow these steps:

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    
2.  Make sure you have a compatible database management system (e.g., MySQL) installed and running.
    
3.  Create a new database instance for OpenDAoC. You can choose any suitable name for your database.
    
4.  Import the individual `.sql` files located in the `opendaoc-db-core` or `opendaoc-db-pvp` folders into your newly created database using your preferred method, such as command-line tools or a GUI client.
    
5.  If you haven't already and once the import is complete, configure `OpenDAoC-Core` or `OpenDAoC-PvP` to connect to your database. 
    
6.  Start the server.


### Combining the files
To increase the maintainability of the database and leverage GitHub's diff/branching capabilities, the database is now provided in multiple .sql files, divided per single table.

These files are organized into two folders: `opendaoc-db-core` and `opendaoc-db-pvp`.

Although this is not required, users can combine the files back into a single file for easier import into a database management system.

To combine the files back together, users should download the [SQLSplit][1] utility from the [SQLSplit GitHub Releases page][2] and reference the tool's README for its usage.

Alternatively, users can work with the single table files as needed.
