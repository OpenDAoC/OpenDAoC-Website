title: What is OpenDAoC?
description: A brief introduction to OpenDAoC.
---

OpenDAoC is a .Net 6.0 application that emulates a DAoC server.  
OpenDAOC is provided as source code and can be compiled and run on Windows or Linux. It is also provided as a Docker container that can be run on any platform that supports Docker.

Originally, we were a fork of the [Dawn of Light][1] project and it was known as Atlas.  
However, we have since diverged from the original project and have rewritten most of the codebase.

To learn more about the our motivations, please see [this page][2].
