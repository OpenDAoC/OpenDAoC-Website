## The Hunt Begins!

By typing `/predator join` while within 30,000 units of the active conquest target, you are queued into a pool of similar players.


:::caution[Solo Only!]
This is a **solo-only** activity.
:::

You are tasked with the objective of hunting down a random player of an opposing realm. Similarly, you are likewise chosen as a hunt target for another random player, so stay on your toes! Hunters are given some details regarding their prey via /predator prey, including: player name, race, and zone location.

Killing your prey will reward you with a substantial amount of RPs and Atlas Orbs. Killing your prey automatically re-enters you in the queue with a new target.

Joining a group, quitting the game, leaving RvR zones, or typing /predator abandon will remove you from the hunt.
