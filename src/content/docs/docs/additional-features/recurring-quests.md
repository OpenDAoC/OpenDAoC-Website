Recurring Quests are intended to be a recurring reward system that keeps players entertained and rewarded for participating in various aspects of the game world. There are currently two formats of Recurring Quest: Daily and Weekly.

They function similar to a normal in-game quest, and task the player with completing one or more objectives. Upon completion they as completed and removed from the journal. Unlike normal quests, however, any completed quests will reset at a specific time and become available for the player again to complete the next day/week.

## Starting Recurring Quests

Recurring Quests can be found in the three primary border keeps: Castle Sauvage (ALB), Svasud Faste (MID), and Druim Ligen (HIB).

## Rollover Times

**Daily Quests** are reset and will become available again at midnight UTC.

**Weekly Quests** are reset and will become available again at 12:01am Mondays UTC.

The server time is based in UTC and all times will be displayed in that timezone.

## Types of Recurring Quests

**Daily Player Vs. Enemy (PvE) Quests**
These quests will task the player with killing NPCs in the game world.
Some examples of this quest type are:
- Kill 10 insects
- Kill 10 monsters in a dungeon
- Kill <named dungeon NPC>

**Daily Realm Vs. Realm (RvR) Quests**
These quests will task the player with killing other players, or completing RvR objectives.
Some examples of this quest type are:
- Kill 15 players
- Capture a keep
- Kill 10 players in Darkness Falls

**Daily `Hardcore` Player Vs. Enemy (Hardcore PvE) Quests**
These quests will challenge the player to complete certain PvE tasks (similar to above) with the following restrictions:
- If a player dies with this quest in their journal, the `quest will be aborted`.
- If a player joins a group with this quest in their journal, the `quest will be aborted`.
- If the quest is aborted for any reason, it is considered 'failed' for that day/week and will become available again at the normal rollover.

**Weekly Quests**
These quests will challenge the player with completing large-scale goals, usually involving endgame content.
Some examples of this quest type are:
- Kill the dragon
- Clear the epic dungeon
- Kill 100 players
