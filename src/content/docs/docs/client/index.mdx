To connect to OpenDAoC servers, any game client running `game.dll` version `1.127` will work.

Alternatively, we provide our own client, which is a modified version of the official client, including:

- Custom splash screens
- Classic Towns
- Classic Capital Cities
- Classic Capitals
- Classic Darkness Falls
- Old Frontiers
- All features from version 1.127, including UI scaling

## Additional Information

Using the OpenDAoC client is completely optional, but it is recommended if using the official [OpenDAoC database][1].

The default path for `user.dat` and `characters.ini` is `%AppData%\Electronic Arts\Dark Age of Camelot\OpenDAoC`.

The OpenDAoC client is a modified version of the official client, which means that it will not work with the official servers.
