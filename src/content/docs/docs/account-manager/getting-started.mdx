The OpenDAoC account manager is a web application that allows your players to create and manage their accounts using their Discord account.  
It is built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework, and is designed to be fully customizable.

As always, we recommend the use of Docker for deployment, but you can also set up the account manager manually if you prefer.  
The source is available on [GitHub][1] and a live demo is available at [account.opendaoc.com][2].
